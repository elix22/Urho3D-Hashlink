# Urho3D-Hashlink 
This project aims to run Urho3D on the Haxe hashlink runtime .

It's in a very early stage  and I am doing it at my spare time .
I already did some p.o.c.

A sample app can be found in

https://github.com/elix22/Urho3D/tree/hashlink-poc/Source/Samples/72_HashLink

It contatins the code of the Haxe program compiled into haslink/c code and then intgerated into the Sample app.

It is verified to be running fine on desktop , iOS and Android .
On Emscripten there are some issue that need to be fixed.
