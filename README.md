# Urho3D-Hashlink 
This project aims to run Urho3D on the Haxe hashlink runtime .

It's in a very early stage  and I am doing it at my spare time .
I already did some p.o.c.

It contatins the code of the Haxe program compiled into haslink/c code and then intgerated into the Sample app.

It is verified to be running fine on desktop , iOS and Android .
On Emscripten there are some issue that need to be fixed.
